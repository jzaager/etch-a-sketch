# The Odin Project - Foundations Path

## Etch-a-Sketch

Another classic game brought to life on this very internet.

### Getting familiar with JavaScript

**DOM Corleone**

This project was a bit more complex than the [Rock Paper Scissors](https://jzaager.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) project, but an excellent challenge nonetheless. There was significantly more DOM manipulation and use of event listeners. Everything from creating the drawing area of the sketch device to getting the device to function properly in response to mouseovers and button clicks proved to be a bit tricky. 

One quick fix that tripped me up was not realizing that some event listeners initially were called before the drawing area existed, and therefore were not altering the grid as expected (obviously).

**CSS I Must Profess**

A functional but brute force design. This stems from some, but not enough planning, and doubling down instead of starting over. Likely my most important takeaway from this project is to devise an even better plan before getting started.

**Under my HTML-a** 

HTML truly is the gift that keeps on giving. Takeaway here is learning about the very versatile <input> selector.
* Range (slider)
* Color (color-selector)

#### Features added:
* Rainbow button
* Media query for screens 800px wide (not fully functional on mobile)
